# SpellCraft 

Spellcraft is a Literacy Quiz Game that tests the players spelling skills. Players will be given an incomplete word, with the word also having a certain amount of letters required to complete it. For example : b _ _ t. Then the player has to come up with as many words they can think of while the timer is running. 

If they type in a word registered in the dictionary, the score will go up. words like Boot, Boat, Beat, etc. Incorrect words will not count towards the score : Bullet (too many letters) Goat (incorrect letters) Bxyt (not a real word) 

Every time a different word in the same given incomplete word is submitted, they will gain +1 extra point. For example : Boot (+1), Boat(+2), Beat(+3). Once the timer runs out, the given word changes, and the score bonus comes back down to 1. 

The game will continue as long as the user can input more than 2 different words for the same prompt.
